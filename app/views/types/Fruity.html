<p>Fruits have been used as a beer adjunct for centuries. Cherry, raspberry, and peach are a common 
addition to this style of beer. Modern breweries may add only flavored extracts to the finished product,
rather than actually fermenting the fruit.</p>

<p>Some historic <a href="#/types/Ale">ales</a> used fruit to generate a second fermentation
in the cask; brewers try to recreate this in modern beers.</p>
