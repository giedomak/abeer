<p>Dark beers are beers which have a dark colour. Although beers using naturally dried malt would 
have been pale-coloured, by the 17th century most malts in Europe would have been dried over a fire,
resulting in a dark coloured beer. Examples of dark beers are <a href="http://abeerfor.me/#/types/Brown">brown beers</a>
and <a href="http://abeerfor.me/#/types/Stout">stout</a>.</p>
