<p>Lager (German: storage) is a type of beer that is fermented and conditioned at low temperatures.
<span ng-show="UM.types.ale.visited > 0">Compared to <a href="#/types/Lager">ale yeasts</a>, lager yeast ferments more slowly, and
often produces a less sweet and less fruity taste.</span>

available style of beer in the world.</p>

<p>Lagers in certain countries often feature large proportions of adjuncts, usually rice or maize.
Adjuncts entered <a href="#/countries/UnitedStates">United States</a>
brewing as a means of thinning out the body of U.S. beers, balancing the large quantities 
of protein introduced by six-row barley. Adjuncts are often used now in beer making to introduce 
a large quantity of sugar, and thereby increase <a href="#/strengths">ABV</a>,
at a lower price than a formulation using an all-malt grain bill. There are however cases in which 
adjunct usage actually increases the cost of manufacture.</p>
